# Movie Predictions Using A Linear Regression Model In R

This project was completed as the final project for the course Linear Regression and Modelling which is part of Coursera's Statistics With R specialisation. 

The project involves building a linear regression model using R to answer a research question on movie data from the IMDB website. It also involves an EDA stage which explores the data in order to formulate a sensible research question.
